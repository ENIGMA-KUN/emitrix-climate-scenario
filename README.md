## Overview

The Emitrix Climate Scenario Analysis Platform provides organizations with AI-powered climate scenario modeling capabilities to assess climate-related risks and opportunities, support strategic decision-making, and meet regulatory reporting requirements. The platform focuses initially on Scope 1 emissions reduction pathways while being architected to expand to comprehensive scenario analysis covering all emission scopes, physical and transition risks, and financial impacts.

Current implementation focuses on the Moderate Reduction scenario (Scenario 2), achieving a 30% emissions reduction by 2030 through a balanced technology implementation approach.

## Features

- **Scope 1 Emissions Reduction Modeling**: Model different reduction pathways with detailed source-level analysis
- **Technology Transition Simulation**: Evaluate the impact of different technology mixes and implementation timelines
- **Financial Impact Analysis**: Calculate carbon pricing impacts, implementation costs, ROI, and payback periods
- **Interactive Visualization**: Explore results through an intuitive dashboard built with Streamlit
- **Statistical Forecasting**: Generate emissions trends using multiple statistical models
- **TCFD-Aligned Reporting**: Generate outputs aligned with Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/enigma-kun/emitrix-climate-scenario.git
   cd emitrix-climate-scenario
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv

### Running the Application

Launch the Streamlit interface:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will be available in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

### Using the Dashboard

1. **Configure Scenario Parameters**:
   - Set your reduction target (e.g., 30% by 2030)
   - Adjust carbon price parameters (starting price and annual increase)
   - Define technology implementation mix (electric boilers, electric vehicles, etc.)
   - Set financial parameters like discount rate

2. **Run the Model**:
   - Click "Run Model" to execute the scenario analysis

3. **Explore Results**:
   - View emissions reduction pathway
   - Analyze financial impacts
   - Examine technology transition timeline
   - Review key performance metrics

### Example Scenario: Moderate Reduction (30% by 2030)

The default "Moderate Reduction" scenario aims to achieve a 30% reduction in Scope 1 emissions by 2030 through:

- Gradual technology implementation starting in 2026
- Fuel switching for 50% of sources by 2030
- Equipment efficiency upgrades with 5-year payback periods
- Carbon price starting at $30/tCO2e with 5% annual increase

## Data Requirements

The platform currently operates with sample generated data. For real-world implementation, organizations will need to provide:

### Required Data Types
- Historical Scope 1 emissions data (3-5 years, monthly or quarterly)
